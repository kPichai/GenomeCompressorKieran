Thus compacting the space by a little bit, however, doing this is quite inefficient and doesn't have as big of an affect as the method shown below. |
| Nov. 14 | 12:30am - 1:10am | Although I didn't have much time to code a solution I did come up with an outline for compressing the data. In java, every char is stored with 16 bits, however given the specifc disticntino of this problem set that our dictionary is old 4 characters big, ACTG, then we can use a similar hashing method as before. This means that A could be 00, C could be 01, T could be 10, and G could be 11. Each has a unique code such that 10000111 has to be TACG and nothing else. Using this method to store each original char in 2 bits compared to 16 we have now store 16 DNA bases in one single int, as an int I believe is 32 bits long in java. Previously in 32 bits you could've only stored 2 chars, now we can store 16. That is a almost 90% space compression. Additionally, due to the nature of DNA sequences it is highly common for short segments to be repeated, in particular sequences to do TT... or AA... as they are the beginning signal of encoding regions of DNA (and thus have many repeats to ensure that if one base gets removed there are still plenty of the barrier left). Therefore, we can utilize this to apply a similar logic to the following. If our string is (AAABBCCCCCD) we could encode that too (3AB5CD). Encoding the repeats of anything with more than 2. In our case we could do if there are more than 16 repeats of that specific code. This is a marginal improvement but at least is a very specific and exact way of solving this problem with huge space compressions. |
